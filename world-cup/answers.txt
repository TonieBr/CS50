Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
After a certain number it makes no meaningful difference to increase the N.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
Starting at N = 100 the program makes a good enough prediction if taking performance into account.
