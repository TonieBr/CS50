        <h1>Raccoon Police Department</h1>
        <p>The Raccoon Police Station was established in 1969, when the newly formed Raccoon Police Department purchased a former art museum in Downtown Raccoon City.
Raccoon City Destruction Incident</p>

<p>When the t-Virus contaminated the drinking water in September 1998, tens of thousands transformed into Zombies within hours, and the police were called into duty, with many rallying at the station to defend it. In the early hours, the police station took in many civilians as refugees, including Sherry Birkin. On September 25, having gone insane, Chief Irons ordered for the police station's weapons locker to be emptied and weapons and ammunition scattered throughout. Due to these orders, police took casualties in the fighting against zombie intruders due to ammunition shortages. On September 26, dozens of officers, including SWAT, were sent out of the station altogether to engage the zombies head-on, and were massacred as a result. Those left inside endured further attacks on the station on the 27th, and faced Lickers, mutations of the Zombies they failed to kill.</p>

<p> September 28, the officers were attacked in their operations conference room and took serious casualties, including David Ford who may have been their senior. The survivors began drawing up plans to escape through the sewers, and Lieutenant Marvin Branagh helped Rita Philips escape through a secret tunnel in a plan to call over a rescue van; when Harry did arrive however, the station had been attacked again and Branagh was too injured to join them. Later that day, former S.T.A.R.S. officers Jill Valentine and Brad Vickers attempted to find shelter in the station, but were attacked by the Nemesis-T Type, a B.O.W. sent by Umbrella Europe to kill them.<p>

<p>By September 29, the only personnel left were Chief Irons, Lieutenant Branagh, and Elliot Edward. Sherry Birkin and Ben Bertolucci were left as the sole remaining civilians, the former due to her small size allowing her to use ducts, and the latter due to being sealed in a prison cell. That night, RPD rookie Leon S. Kennedy, college student Claire Redfield, and spy Ada Wong entered the police station for their own reasons, and witnessed the deaths of the last officers.<p>

<p>On September 30, USS agent HUNK entered the police station to rendezvous with a helicopter at the front gate. On October 1, the precinct was decimated along with the rest of the city due to the Sterilization Operation carried by the United States Air Force on the orders of the U.S. president.</p>
