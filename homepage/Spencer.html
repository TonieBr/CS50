      <h1>Spencer Mansion</h1>
      <p>
      The Spencer Mansion was mansion in Arklay County, United States, several miles northwest of Raccoon City within Raccoon Forest. It was designed by George Trevor of Trevor & Chamberlain fame and completed in November 1967. Although officially serving as a country club for Umbrella Corporation executives and distinguished clientele, actual guests were rare if at all existent, and the mansion was primarily used as office space for the underground Arklay Laboratory complex, a top-secret facility used for the clandestine bioweapons research known to The Pentagon, with the mansion serving as a facade to hide the shipments of personnel and equipment in plain site.
      </p>

      In May 1998 the mansion was contaminated by an outbreak of t-Virus, the mind-altering effects of which led to a deterioration of authority as cannibalistic murders, animal attacks and shootings became commonplace. The facility was deemed lost in July after several attacks in the forest reached national headlines, and to cover-up the research the Umbrella-funded S.T.A.R.S. police force was sent in to destroy the facility during a police investigation of the area, accomplishing their mission on 25 July. Due to the restrictions imposed on the region by the US military and the CDC, no attempts since 1998 have been made to investigate the ruins.
